When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repo is helpful in that it can save all your data in case your local machine gets corrupted or all your data from 
your local machine is erased in the event of any failure. Any damage to your local machine does not mean the remote repo
stored remotely in some other computer gets damaged . That is one big advantage of creating a remote repo.
